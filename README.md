# RAG-with-Milvus
This repository implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Milvus vector store, designed specifically for PDF documents. By integrating Milvus, a highly efficient vector database, this project enables fast and scalable storage and retrieval of PDF embeddings, allowing for knowledge extraction from large collection of documents.
